            Electronic supergroup Swedish House Mafia house rose to prominence in the 2000s with their high-energy brand
            of EDM and progressive house music. Showcasing the combined talents of established DJ/producers Axwell,
            Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso, the group built upon their live festival buzz, scoring international
            hits with tracks like "One (Your Name)" featuring Pharrell Williams and "Miami 2 Ibiza" with Tinie Tempah,
            both of which helped 2010's Until One reach the Top Five of the U.K. and U.S. dance charts. Their sophomore
            compilation, 2012's Until Now, fared even better, cracking the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and spawning the
            hits "Save the World" and "Don't You Worry Child" featuring John Martin. Following a five-year break to
            pursue solo projects, Swedish House Mafia reunited and in 2022 released their official debut album, Paradise
            Again.

            Two years later, Swedish House Mafia embarked on a well-publicized farewell tour in support of their second
            compilation album, 2012's Until Now. Another compilation of previously released tracks, the set was
            extremely successful, going platinum in Sweden and reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. The release of
            One Last Tour: A Live Soundtrack brought the project to a close in 2014. Following the group's end, Angello
            focused on a successful solo career, while Axwell & Ingrosso launched their own high-profile duo. On March
            25, 2018, Swedish House Mafia reunited, playing a surprise closing set at the 20th anniversary Ultra Music
            Festival in Miami, Florida. They also embarked on a 2019 Save the World Reunion Tour and signed with
            Republic Records. Beginning in 2021, the group began releasing singles from their first proper studio album
            including "It Gets Better" and "Moth to a Flame" featuring the Weeknd.
